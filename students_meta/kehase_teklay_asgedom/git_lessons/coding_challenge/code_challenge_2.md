## A Day in the Life of Codey

### Morning Routine

Every morning, Codey follows a strict routine to keep his mind sharp and his paws nimble:

1. **Wake UP**: Codey wakes up at 7:00 AM sharp.
2. **Breakfast**: A hearty blows of milk at 7:30 AM.
3. **Coding Session**: From 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, he dives into code.
4. **Explore**: At 10:00 AM, he explors the digital garden.
5. **Lunch Break**: At 12:00 PM, Codey enjoys a well_deserved meal.

Here's what Codey daily scedule looks like:

### Codey's Coding Challenge

One day, while exploring the digital garden, Codey encountered alocked gate. To unlock it, <br>he needed to write a special function. Codey's process was simple but effective:

- **Identify the Problem**: The gate required a secret code to unlock
- **Write the Function**: Codey quickly wrote a Phython function.
- **Test the Code**: He tested the code with the correct secret key.

Here's the code Codey wrote:

````
def unlock_gate(secret_code):
# The correct secret code
key = "MEOW123"
if secret_code == key:
print("Gate unlocked! Welcome to the digital garden, Codey!")
else:
print("Access denied. Try again, Codey!")
# Codey tries the code
unlock_gate("MEOW123")
```
````

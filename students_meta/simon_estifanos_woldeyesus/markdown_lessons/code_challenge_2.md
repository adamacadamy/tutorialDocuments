1. **wake up**:codey wakes up at 7:00am sharp.
2. **Breaksfat**: a hearty blows of milk at 7:30am.
3. **coding sessions**: From 8:00am, he dives into coding.
4. ** Explore**: At 10:00am, he explores the digital garden.

### Codey's Coding Challenge

One day, while exploring the digital garden, Codey encountered a locked gate. to unlock it, <br> he needed to write a special function. Codey's process was simple but effective:

- **Identify the problem**: The gate required a secret code to unlock
- **Write the Function**: Codey quickly wrte a python funsction.
- **Test the code**: He tested the code with the correct secret key.

Here's the code Codey wrote:

````
def unlock_gate(secret_code):
# The correct secret code
key = "MEOW123"
if secret_code == key:
print("Gate unlocked! Welcome to the digital garden, Codey!")
else:
print("Access denied. Try again, Codey!")
# Codey tries the code
unlock_gate("MEOW123")
```

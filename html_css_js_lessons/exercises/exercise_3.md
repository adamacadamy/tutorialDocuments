# Inline-Block Gallery with `div` Tags Exercise

**Objective:**  
Create an inline-block gallery with 10 images, each wrapped inside a `div` tag. Apply CSS to style the gallery layout and add a hover effect to each `div` that scales up the image when hovered.

---

## Questions:

1. **HTML Structure:**
    - Create an HTML page with 10 images.
    - Each image should be wrapped inside a `div` tag with the class `image-container`.
    - All `div` elements should be placed inside a parent `div` with the class `gallery`.

2. **Inline-Block Layout:**
    - Using CSS, ensure that the 10 `div` tags are arranged next to each other using `display: inline-block`.
    - Ensure that each `div` fits properly in the available width and wraps to the next line if there isn’t enough space.
  
3. **Spacing:**
    - Add 10px of spacing (padding) inside each `div` for the image.
    - Add a margin between each `div` to create consistent spacing around the images.

4. **Border and Background:**
    - Add a 1px solid border around each `div` element.
    - Set a light background color (e.g., `#fff`) inside each `div`.

5. **Hover Effect:**
    - Apply a hover effect using the `:hover` pseudo-class.
    - When the user hovers over any image `div`, the image and `div` should scale up by 10%.

6. **Image Sizing:**
    - Ensure that each image fits within the boundaries of its `div` without exceeding the container width or distorting the image’s aspect ratio.

7. **Extra Challenge:**
    - Add a box shadow to each `div` element to create a subtle 3D effect.
    - Make sure the shadow increases slightly on hover for emphasis.

8. **Optional Challenge:**
    - How would you ensure there is no white space between the `inline-block` `div` tags in HTML without modifying the HTML structure?
    - Try to use CSS to handle the whitespace issue between `inline-block` elements.

## Bonus Question:
- What CSS properties would you modify to make the images responsive, ensuring they resize automatically when the window is resized?

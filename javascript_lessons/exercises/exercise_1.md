# 20 JavaScript Basics Exercises

Below is a list of 20 JavaScript exercise questions for beginners, organized in a logical order progressing from basic concepts (variables, operators) to slightly more challenging ones (arrays, functions, and problem-solving). These are designed to build your skills step-by-step.

## Exercises

1. **Variables Basics**  
   Write a program to declare two variables: one for your first name and one for your age. Print a sentence like: "My name is [name] and I am [age] years old."

2. **Swapping Values**  
   Swap the values of two variables (e.g., `a = 5` and `b = 10`) without using a third variable.

3. **Arithmetic Operations**  
   Create a program that takes two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

4. **Even or Odd**  
   Write a script to check if a given number is even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`).

5. **Positive, Negative, or Zero**  
   Write a program that takes a number and checks if it’s positive, negative, or zero.

6. **Grade Checker**  
   Create a program that takes a score (0-100) and prints "A" (90-100), "B" (80-89), "C" (70-79), "D" (60-69), or "F" (below 60).

7. **Counting 1 to 10**  
   Write a program to print all numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.

8. **Even Numbers**  
   Use a `while` loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 20.

9. **Simple Function**  
   Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

10. **Reverse a String**  
    Create a function that takes a string and returns it in reverse order (e.g., "hello" → "olleh").

11. **Array of Fruits**  
    Write a program to create an array of 5 fruits and print each fruit on a new line.

12. **Largest Number**  
    Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number.

13. **Vowel Counter**  
    Write a program that takes a string and counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) it contains.

14. **Capitalize Words**  
    Create a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence (e.g., "hello world" → "Hello World").

15. **Leap Year Check**  
    Write a program that takes a year and checks if it’s a leap year (divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400).

16. **FizzBuzz**  
    Create a "fizzbuzz" program: Print numbers 1 to 20, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".

17. **Multiplication Table**  
    Write a program to print a multiplication table for a given number (e.g., for 5: "5 x 1 = 5" up to "5 x 10 = 50").

18. **Star Pattern**  
    Use a loop to print this pattern: `*`, `**`, `***`, `****`, `*****`.

19. **Factorial Calculator**  
    Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).

20. **Temperature Converter**  
    Create a script that takes a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit (formula: °F = °C × 9/5 + 32).

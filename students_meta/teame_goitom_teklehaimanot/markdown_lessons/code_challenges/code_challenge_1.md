## Introduction

Semere, a 25-year-old Eritrean, is an **open-minded** young man whose *curiosity* and thirst for knowledge drive him to try something new every single day. He worked in home care for several years but eventually grew bored. Tired of performing the same tasks day in and day out, he began searching for a change.

> **Albert Einstein** once said, "_Adversity introduces a man to himself._" 

This quote resonated with Semere as he embarked on a new journey of **problem-solving** and personal development. His love for solving problems and his belief that _every_ problem has a solution encouraged him to view obstacles as opportunities for growth.

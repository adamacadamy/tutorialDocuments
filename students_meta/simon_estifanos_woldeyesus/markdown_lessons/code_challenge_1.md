> How to Be a Good Programmer
To become a good programmer, follow these simple steps:

1. **Learn the Basics**
Understand core concepts like *data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving*.

2. **Practice Regularly**
The more you code, the better you get. Build projects, solve coding challenges, ~~and learn from your mistakes~~.

3. **Write Clean Code**
Make your code easy to read and maintain by using clear names, proper formatting, and comments when needed.

4. **Use Version Control**
Learn tools like Git to track changes and collaborate with others.

5. **Stay Curious**
Keep learning new technologies and improving your skills as programming evolves quickly.

6. **Communicate Well**
Work well with others by explaining ideas clearly and listening to feedback.
```

By doing these things consistently, you'll become a strong and effective programmer.

When Grace Hopper, a pioneer in computer science, was working on the first computer, the Mark I, she encountered an unexpected problem: the machine wasnâ€™t working. After some investigation, she found that a moth had gotten trapped inside one of the relays, causing a malfunction. She removed the bug, and from that moment on, `"debugging"` became a term used in programming

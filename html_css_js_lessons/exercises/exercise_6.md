# Media Query Code Challenges

Here are some code challenge exercises based on the media query tutorial. These exercises are designed to help you practice creating responsive designs without using Flexbox.

## Code Challenge 1: Basic Media Query Implementation

**Objective:** Create a simple webpage that changes its background color at different screen sizes.

1. Create an HTML file with a `<div>` that contains some text.
2. Write a CSS file that:
   - Sets the default background color to light blue.
   - Changes the background color to light green when the screen width is 768 pixels or more.
   - Changes the background color to light coral when the screen width is less than 480 pixels.
   
**Bonus:** Use the `orientation` media query to change the background color to lavender in portrait orientation.

## Code Challenge 2: Responsive Navigation Bar Without Flexbox

**Objective:** Create a responsive navigation bar that changes layout based on screen size.

1. Create an HTML file with a simple navigation bar containing four links (`Home`, `About`, `Services`, `Contact`).
2. Write CSS to:
   - Display the navigation links horizontally in a row using `inline-block`.
   - Stack the links vertically when the screen width is 600 pixels or less.
   
**Bonus:** Change the text color of the navigation links when in vertical mode.

## Code Challenge 3: Responsive Grid Layout Without Flexbox

**Objective:** Build a simple grid layout that changes based on screen size.

1. Create an HTML file containing a container `<div>` with three child `<div>` elements, each representing a grid item.
2. Write CSS to:
   - Display the grid items in a single column by default (mobile view).
   - Display the grid items in two columns when the screen width is 600 pixels or more.
   - Display the grid items in three columns when the screen width is 900 pixels or more.
   
**Bonus:** Add a `hover` effect to the grid items that changes their background color.

## Code Challenge 4: Image Gallery with Responsive Columns

**Objective:** Create an image gallery that adapts its column layout using media queries.

1. Create an HTML file with a container `<div>` that contains six image elements.
2. Write CSS to:
   - Display the images in a single column for screen widths less than 500 pixels.
   - Display the images in two columns for screen widths between 500 pixels and 800 pixels.
   - Display the images in four columns for screen widths greater than 800 pixels.
   
**Bonus:** Add padding between the images to create a visual gap between the columns.

## Code Challenge 5: Responsive Card Layout

**Objective:** Build a card layout that adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.

1. Create an HTML file with a container `<div>` that holds four card elements. Each card contains an image, a title, and a short description.
2. Write CSS to:
   - Display the cards in a single column for screen widths less than 600 pixels.
   - Display the cards in a two-column layout for screen widths between 600 and 900 pixels.
   - Display the cards in a three-column layout for screen widths greater than 900 pixels.
   
**Bonus:** Change the card's background color when hovering over it.

## Code Challenge 6: Adjust Text Size Using Media Queries

**Objective:** Make text size responsive based on screen width.

1. Create an HTML file with a heading and a paragraph of text.
2. Write CSS to:
   - Set a base font size for the text.
   - Increase the font size of both the heading and paragraph for screen widths greater than 800 pixels.
   - Decrease the font size for screen widths smaller than 500 pixels.
   
**Bonus:** Change the font style (e.g., italic, bold) for screens in portrait orientation.

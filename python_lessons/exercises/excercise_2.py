# Python Code Challenge: Functions and List Comprehensions

# Challenge 1: Define a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.
# The function should use list comprehension.
""" 
 l1= [1, 2,3 ]
 l2=[1,23,4]
 df ex_ev_li(l1,l2)
   returns [n%2=0]
"""
# Challenge 2: Define a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list with the strings that have more than 5 characters.
# Use list comprehension for filtering.

# Challenge 3: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of their squares.
# Use list comprehension to achieve this.

# Challenge 4: Write a function that accepts two lists of the same length and returns a list of tuples,
# where each tuple contains elements from the two lists at the corresponding positions (same index). Use list comprehension.



# Challenge 5: Create a function that takes a sentence (string) and returns a list of the lengths of each word in the sentence.
# Use list comprehension to split the sentence and calculate the lengths.

# Challenge 6: Define a function that filters out words from a list that do not start with a vowel.
# Use list comprehension and a helper function that checks if a word starts with a vowel.

# Challenge 7: Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of booleans indicating whether each number is greater than 10.
# Use list comprehension for this task.

# Challenge 8: Create a function that takes a list of dictionaries and returns a list of the values for a given key.
# Use list comprehension to extract the values.

# Challenge 9: Write a function that accepts a list of words and returns a list of the words with their first letter capitalized.
# Use list comprehension to achieve this.

# Challenge 10: Write a function that returns the common elements between two lists.
# Use list comprehension and the "in" operator to find common elements.

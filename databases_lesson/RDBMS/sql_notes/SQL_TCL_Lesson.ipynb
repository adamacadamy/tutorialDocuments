    "\n",

    "- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made during the current transaction.\n",
    "- **ROLLBACK**: Reverts changes made during the current transaction.\n",
    "- **SAVEPOINT**: Sets a savepoint within a transaction to which you can roll back.\n",
    "- **SET TRANSACTION**: Configures the properties of the current transaction (e.g., isolation level)."

    "A transaction is a sequence of SQL operations performed as a single unit. It has the following properties, known as **ACID** properties:\n",
    "- **Atomicity**: All operations are completed; if any operation fails, the entire transaction fails.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: The database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Transactions are executed independently without interference.\n",
    "- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent."

    "- Always use `BEGIN TRANSACTION` before making a series of changes to the database.\n",
    "- Use `COMMIT` only after verifying that all changes are correct.\n",
    "- Use `ROLLBACK` to undo changes in case of errors or unexpected issues.\n",

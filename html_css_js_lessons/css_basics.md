## What is CSS?

**CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects like SVG or XHTML). CSS controls the look and feel of the web pages and is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

## How CSS Works

CSS works by applying styles to HTML elements based on selectors. A CSS file is linked to an HTML file, and the browser reads the CSS to determine how to display the HTML content.

## Basic Structure of CSS

A CSS rule is made up of:

1. **Selector**: Indicates which HTML element(s) the style rule will apply to.
2. **Property**: A style attribute you want to change, like color, font-size, or margin.
3. **Value**: Specifies the value of the property.

**Example**:
```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

In this example:
- `p` is the selector, meaning the style applies to all `<p>` (paragraph) elements.
- `color` and `font-size` are properties.
- `blue` and `16px` are the values of those properties.

## What Can You Style with CSS?

CSS allows you to style a wide range of properties, including:

1. **Text**:
   - `color`: Changes the color of the text.
   - `font-size`: Controls the size of the text.
   - `font-family`: Specifies the font to be used.
   - `font-weight`: Makes text bold, light, etc.
   - `text-align`: Aligns text to left, right, center, or justify.

2. **Layout**:
   - `margin`: Space outside the element.
   - `padding`: Space inside the element, between the content and the border.
   - `border`: Adds a border around the element.
   - `width` and `height`: Set the size of the element.
   - `display`: Controls the display behavior (e.g., `block`, `inline`, `flex`).

3. **Colors and Backgrounds**:
   - `background-color`: Sets the background color.
   - `background-image`: Sets a background image.
   - `background-size`: Controls the size of the background image.
   - `opacity`: Sets the transparency level.

4. **Positioning**:
   - `position`: Controls the positioning of elements (`static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`).
   - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`: Positioning offsets.

5. **Lists and Tables**:
   - `list-style`: Controls the appearance of list items.
   - `border-spacing`: Sets the spacing between table cells.

6. **Responsive Design**:
   - `media queries`: Apply different styles based on screen size or device type.
   - `flexbox` and `grid`: Layout models that allow for flexible and responsive designs.

## How to Apply CSS
### 1. Inline CSS
You can apply CSS directly to an HTML element using the style attribute:

```html
<p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>x`
```
### 2. Internal CSS

You can define CSS rules within the `<style>` tag inside the HTML document's `<head>` section:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

### 3. External CSS

The most common way to apply CSS is by linking an external CSS file to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

Then, you write your CSS rules in the external `styles.css` file.

## CSS Selectors

CSS selectors allow you to target specific HTML elements to apply styles.

### Basic Selectors:

- **Type Selector**: Selects all elements of a specific type.

  ```css
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
  ```

- **Class Selector**: Selects elements with a specific class. Classes are defined in HTML with the `class` attribute and selected in CSS with a `.` before the class name.

  ```css
  .example-class {
    color: red;
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <p class="example-class">This is red text.</p>
  ```

- **ID Selector**: Selects an element with a specific ID. IDs are defined in HTML with the `id` attribute and selected in CSS with a `#` before the ID name.

  ```css
  #example-id {
    color: green;
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <p id="example-id">This is green text.</p>
  ```

- **Universal Selector**: Selects all elements.

  ```css
  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
  ```

### Grouping Selectors:

You can group multiple selectors that share the same styles:

```css
h1, h2, h3 {
  color: purple;
}
```

### Descendant Selector:

You can target an element that is inside another element:

```css
div p {
  color: orange;
}
```

This targets all `<p>` elements inside a `<div>`.

## CSS Box Model
![alt text](images/box_model.png)

Every HTML element is a rectangular box, and CSS uses the **box model** to determine the size, padding, border, and margin of that box. Understanding the box model is crucial for layout design.

- **Content**: The actual content of the element (e.g., text, image).
- **Padding**: Space between the content and the border.
- **Border**: A line surrounding the padding (if any) and content.
- **Margin**: Space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.

### Example:

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
}
```

This example creates a `div` with a content width of 200px, 10px padding, a 2px black border, and a 20px margin around it.

## CSS Layout

CSS provides several properties to control the layout of elements on the page.

### Display

The `display` property specifies how an element is displayed.

- **block**: The element takes up the full width available (e.g., `div`, `p`).
- **inline**: The element takes up only as much width as it needs (e.g., `span`, `a`).
- **inline-block**: Like `inline`, but allows setting width and height.

```css
div {
  display: block;
}

span {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
}
```

### Positioning

The `position` property specifies the positioning of an element.

- **static**: The default position; elements are placed in the normal document flow.
- **relative**: Positioned relative to its normal position.
- **absolute**: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
- **fixed**: Positioned relative to the browser window.
- **sticky**: A hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.

### Example:

```css
div {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
```

This moves the `div` 10px down and 20px right from its normal position.

### Flexbox

Flexbox is a powerful layout tool that makes it easier to design flexible and responsive layouts.

- **flex-container**: The parent element that holds the items.
- **flex-items**: The child elements inside the container.

Example:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

This creates a flex container with items spaced evenly within the container.

## CSS Colors

CSS provides several ways to define colors:

- **Color Names**: `red`, `blue`, `green`
- **Hex Codes**: `#ff0000`, `#00ff00`, `#0000ff`
- **RGB**: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`, `rgb(0, 255, 0)`, `rgb(0, 0, 255)`
- **RGBA**: Same as RGB, but with an alpha channel for transparency, e.g., `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)`
- **HSL**: Hue, Saturation, Lightness, e.g., `hsl(120, 100%, 50%)`

Example:

```css
p {
  color: #ff6347; /* Tomato color */
  background-color: rgb(240, 248, 255); /* AliceBlue background */
}
```

## Fonts and Text Styling

CSS allows you to control the appearance of text, including fonts, size, style, and alignment.

### Font Family

The `font-family` property specifies the font of the text. You can specify multiple fonts as a fallback list:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

### Font Size

The `font-size` property defines the size of the text:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

### Font Style

The `font-style` property can be used to make text italic:

```css
em {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

### Text Alignment

The `text-align` property is used to align text horizontally:

```css
p {
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Text Decoration

The `text-decoration` property is often used to add or remove underlines:

```css
a {
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

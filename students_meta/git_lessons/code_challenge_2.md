**Codey's Coding Challenge**
 
 One day, while exploring the digital garden, Codey encountered a locked gate.To unlock it, he needed to write a special function. Codey's process was simple but effective.

 .**Identify the Problem**: the gate required a secret code to unlock.
 .**Write the Function**: Codey quickly wrote a Python function.
 .**Test the Code**: He tested the code with the correct secret key.

 Here's the code Codey wrote:

 ````
 def unlock_gate(secret_code):
   # The correct secret code
    key = "MEOW123"

    if secret_code == key:
       print("Gate unlocked! Welcome to the digital garden, Codey!")
    else:
     print:("Access denied. Try again, Codey!")

  # Codey tries the code
  unlock_gate("MEOW123")
  ```
  ````

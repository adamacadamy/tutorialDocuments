**Codey's coding challenge**

one day, while exploring the digital garden, Codey encountered a locked gate. To unlock it, he neeeded to write a special function. Codey's process was simple but effective.

**Identify the Problem**: the gate required a secret code to unlock.
**write the Function**: Codey quickly wrote a Python function.
**Test the Code**: He tested the code with the corect secret key.

Here's the code Codey wrote:

````
def unlock_gate(secret_code):
  # The correct secret code
    key = "MEOW123"

    if secret_code == key:
      print("Gate unlocked! Welcome to the digital garden, Codey!")
    else:
      print:("Access denied. Try again, Codey!")

# Codey tries the code
unlock_gate("MEOW123")
````
````

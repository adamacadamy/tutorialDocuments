 # Markdown Challenge: Create a Well-Structured Markdown Document
## Objective

Your task is to create a Markdown document that serves as a mini-tutorial for a topic of your choice. The document should be clear, well-organized, and make good use of Markdown's features.

## Requirements

1. **Document Structure**: 
   - The document should include at least three sections with appropriate headings (`#`, `##`, `###`).
   - Use a table of contents that links to each section.

2. **Text Formatting**:
   - Include examples of bold, italic, and strikethrough text.
   - Use blockquotes to highlight important points or quotes.
   - Demonstrate the use of inline code snippets and code blocks.

3. **Lists**:
   - Include both an ordered list and an unordered list.
   - Use nested lists to show more complex information hierarchies.

4. **Links and Images**:
   - Add a hyperlink to an external resource.
   - Include at least one image with appropriate alt text.

5. **Tables**:
   - Create a table to organize information, with at least three columns and two rows.
   - Include a header row with bolded text.

6. **Advanced Markdown Features**:
   - Use a horizontal rule (`---`) to separate major sections of the document.
   - Embed a YouTube video or other media using Markdown.
   - Add a footnote to provide additional information without cluttering the main content.

## Bonus Features (Optional)

- **Markdown in GitHub**: Include GitHub-specific Markdown features, such as task lists or mentioning users.
- **Markdown Extensions**: Use any Markdown extension (like Mermaid for diagrams) to add additional features to your document.

## Submission

Once you have completed your Markdown document, save it as `README.md`. The document should be easy to read and navigate, demonstrating your ability to effectively use Markdown to create a structured and informative document.

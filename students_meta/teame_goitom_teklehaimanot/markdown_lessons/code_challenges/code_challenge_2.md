# A Day In The Life Of Codey 
## Morning Routine
Every morning Codey follows a strict routine to keep his mind sharp and his paws nimble:

1. **Wake Up:** Codey wakes up at 7:00 AM sharp.
2. **Breakfast:** A hearty bowl of milk at 7:30 AM.
3. **Coding Session:** From 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, he dives into code.
4. **Explore:** At 10:00 AM, he explors the digital garden.
5. **Lunch Break:** At 12:00 PM, Codey enjoys a well-deserved meal.

Here's what Codey daily scedule looks like:

## Codey's Coding Challenge
One day, while exploring the digital garden, Codey encountered a locked gate. To unlock it,
he needed to write a special function. Codey's process was simple but effective: 

- **Identify the Problem:** The gate required a secret code to unlock.
- **Write the Function:** Codey quickly wrote a python function.
- **Test the Code:** He tested the code with the correct secret key.


Here's the Code Codey wrote. 

```python
def unlock_gate (secret_code=):
  # The correct secret code
  Key = "MEAW123"

  if secret_code == key:
     print("Gate unlocked! Welcome to the digital garden, Codey!")
# Codey tries the code
unlock_gate("MEAW123")
```

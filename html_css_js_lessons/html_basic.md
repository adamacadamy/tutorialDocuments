## What is HTML?

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create webpages. It allows you to structure content on the web by using a series of elements. These elements are represented by tags, usually with an opening and closing tag, and the content is placed between these tags.

### Breaking Down HTML:

- **Hypertext**: This refers to text that contains links to other texts or resources. In HTML, you use hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) to connect different pages, allowing users to navigate through various parts of a website or even across the web.
  
- **Text**: The content inside the tags is often text. This text is what will be displayed on the page, formatted according to the HTML tags surrounding it.
  
- **Markup**: HTML is a markup language, which means it uses tags to "mark up" the text. These tags tell the web browser how to display the content, such as making text bold, creating a list, or embedding an image. The tags are part of the markup but are not shown to the user; they only control how the content looks.

In summary, **HTML** allows you to combine links (hypertext) with content (text), structured by tags (markup), to create webpages.

## Structure of an HTML Document

A basic HTML document follows this structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares the document as an HTML5 document.
2. **`<html>`**: The root element that wraps all content on the page.
3. **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title.
4. **`<title>`**: Defines the title of the webpage, shown in the browser tab.
5. **`<body>`**: Contains the visible content of the webpage.

## Common HTML Elements

### Headings

HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important):

```html
<h1>This is an H1 Heading</h1>
<h2>This is an H2 Heading</h2>
<h3>This is an H3 Heading</h3>
<h4>This is an H4 Heading</h4>
<h5>This is an H5 Heading</h5>
<h6>This is an H6 Heading</h6>
```

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are defined using the `<p>` tag:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

### Links

Links are created using the `<a>` tag. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
```

### Images

Images are added using the `<img>` tag. The `src` attribute defines the path to the image, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```

### Lists

There are two types of lists in HTML: **ordered lists** and **unordered lists**.

#### Unordered List:
```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

#### Ordered List:
```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

### Tables

HTML tables are created using the `<table>` tag. You use `<tr>` for table rows, `<th>` for table headers, and `<td>` for table cells:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### Forms

Forms collect user input and can be submitted to a server. Hereâ€™s a basic form structure:

```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email">

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

### Div and Span

- **`<div>`**: A block-level container used to group elements for styling or layout purposes.
- **`<span>`**: An inline container for styling a small piece of text or content within a block-level element.

```html
<div>
  <p>This is inside a div element.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a <span>span element</span> inside a paragraph.</p>
```

## Attributes

HTML tags can have attributes that provide additional information about elements. Common attributes include:

- **`href`**: Specifies the URL for a link.
- **`src`**: Specifies the source of an image or media file.
- **`alt`**: Provides alternative text for images.
- **`id`**: Assigns a unique identifier to an element.
- **`class`**: Specifies a class name for CSS styling.

Example:

```html
<a href="https://example.com" class="button-link">Click Here</a>
<img src="image.png" alt="Example Image">
```

## Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML introduces elements that clearly describe their meaning, improving accessibility and SEO.

Some common semantic tags:

- **`<header>`**: Represents the header section of a webpage or a section.
- **`<nav>`**: Defines a navigation menu.
- **`<main>`**: The main content of the document.
- **`<section>`**: Defines a section within a document.
- **`<article>`**: Represents an independent piece of content.
- **`<footer>`**: Represents the footer of a page or section.

Example:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Website Title</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="#home">Home</a>
    <a href="#about">About</a>
  </nav>
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is an introductory section.</p>
  </section>
  <article>
    <h2>Article Title</h2>
    <p>This is an article.</p>
  </article>
</main>
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2024 Your Website</p>
</footer>
```

## Comments

You can add comments to your HTML code using `<!-- -->`:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

Comments are ignored by the browser and can be useful for documentation.

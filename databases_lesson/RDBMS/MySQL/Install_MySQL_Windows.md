## Step 1: Download MySQL Installer
1. Visit the [MySQL Community Downloads page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).
2. Select **MySQL Installer for Windows** (either the Web or Offline Installer):
   - **Web Installer**: Smaller file size, downloads components during installation.
   - **Offline Installer**: Larger file size, includes all components.
3. Click **Download** and choose a mirror site if prompted.

## Step 2: Run MySQL Installer
1. Locate the downloaded installer file and double-click it to launch the installer.
2. Grant administrator permissions if prompted.

## Step 3: Choose Setup Type
1. You will see multiple setup options:
   - **Developer Default**: Installs MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench, and other tools.
   - **Server Only**: Installs just the MySQL Server.
   - **Custom**: Allows you to select specific components.
2. Select the desired setup type based on your needs and click **Next**.

## Step 4: Resolve Dependencies
1. The installer may prompt you to install additional software, such as:
   - **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**.
2. Follow the instructions to install any missing dependencies.

## Step 5: Configure MySQL Server
1. **Type and Networking**:
   - Choose the configuration type: **Standalone MySQL Server**.
   - Keep the default port **3306** unless you need a different one.
   - Click **Next**.
   
2. **Authentication Method**:
   - Select **Use Strong Password Encryption** (recommended).
   - Click **Next**.

3. **Set Root Password**:
   - Enter a strong root password and confirm it.
   - Optionally, add user accounts for specific purposes (e.g., app access).

4. **Windows Service**:
   - Configure MySQL to run as a Windows Service for automatic startup.
   - Choose a service name or use the default (**MySQL80** for MySQL 8.x).
   - Click **Next**.

5. **Apply Configuration**:
   - Click **Execute** to apply the settings.
   - Ensure all steps are marked as successful before proceeding.

## Step 6: Complete Installation
1. MySQL Workbench and MySQL Shell may be installed automatically (depending on your setup type).
2. Finish the installation and close the installer.

---

## Step 7: Verify Installation
1. **Test MySQL Server**:
   - Open the MySQL Shell or Command Prompt.
   - Run the following command to connect to the MySQL server:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     ```
   - Enter the root password you set earlier. If successful, you'll see the MySQL prompt.

2. **Test with MySQL Workbench**:
   - Launch MySQL Workbench from the Start menu.
   - Create a new connection using `localhost`, `root`, and your password.

---

## Optional: Secure the Installation
Run the `mysql_secure_installation` command in the MySQL Shell or Command Prompt to:
- Remove test databases.
- Disable remote root access (for production environments).

---

## Troubleshooting Tips
1. **Service Not Starting**:
   - Check if the MySQL service is running:
     ```bash
     services.msc
     ```
     Restart the service if necessary.

2. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Ensure port **3306** is not in use by another application.

3. **Access Issues**:
   - Reset the root password if forgotten using the MySQL installer.
